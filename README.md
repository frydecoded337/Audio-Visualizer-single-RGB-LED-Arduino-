# Audio-Visualizer-single-RGB-LED-Arduino-
I made this Arduino program which takes voltages corresponding to frequencies as input and outputs a different color through one RGB LED.
The LED I've used is of the type common cathode so the analogWrite() values are different from a common anode type LED (255 - *common anode value* = *common cathode value*).
